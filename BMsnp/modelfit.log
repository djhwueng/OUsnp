Optimality criterion set to likelihood.

** Model 1 of 56 * Calculating JC **

Likelihood scores of tree(s) in memory:
---------------------------------------
  1000 characters are included
  Likelihood settings:
    Current model:
                             Data type = standard
           Constant-character handling = likelihoods conditioned on assumption that only variable
                                         characters are observed ("Mkv" model)
                           State space = variable
                     State frequencies = equal (required by model)

    Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 699
    Molecular clock not enforced
    Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
    Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, tolerance=1e-10
    Likelihood calculations performed in double precision
    Vector processing disabled (not supported for Mkv models or models with fewer than 4 states)
    Conditional-likelihood rescaling threshold = 1e-20

Tree              1
