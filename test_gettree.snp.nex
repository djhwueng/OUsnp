[The likelihood ratio test statistic is calculated as twice the difference between
the log likelihood scores of the two models constrasted. When the model representing
the null hypothesis is a special case of the alternate model, this statistic
fits a chi-square distribution with a number of degrees of freedom equal to the
number of parameters that freely vary between the two models. A detailed explanation
of the test of the model of DNA substitution can be found in Huelsenbeck and Crandall
Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1997. 28: 437-466]
